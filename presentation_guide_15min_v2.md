## The 60-Second Opening (MEMORIZE)

> "Quick context: Our trading desk is launching a $1M market making initiative on Uniswap v3. Why? We're seeing real demand from institutional clients who need professional on-chain liquidity provision. The opportunity: We discovered LP positions are mathematically identical to selling options strategies—derivatives we already understand. Our edge: We can price these, risk-manage them, and hedge them better than anyone because we speak both TradFi and DeFi. We're projecting $500k Year 1 revenue from a new client segment. Let me show you the strategy and business case..."

### Slide 4: LP Positions ARE Derivatives (90 sec)
**CRITICAL SLIDE** - Your hook

**Key Points**:

---

### Slide 20: Questions (remaining time)

Take 1-2 quick questions, defer detailed ones

---

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "How confident are you in the $500k Year 1 revenue?"

**A (45 sec):** "Moderately confident. We have $15-20M in near-term pipeline from existing relationships, which at 1% management fees is $150-200k just from warm leads. The $500k assumes we close half our pipeline and add some cold outreach. Could be conservative—we're seeing strong inbound interest. Biggest risk is operational: Can we scale client onboarding fast enough?"

---

### Q: "What if there's a smart contract exploit?"

**A (30 sec):** "Real risk, but Uniswap v3 has $4B TVL and has been live for 3+ years with no exploits. We're also limiting position sizes—no more than 20% of client assets in any single pool—and insurance is available through Nexus Mutual. This is similar to counterparty risk with exchanges, which we also manage with position limits."

---

### Q: "Why do clients need us? Can't they just deposit themselves?"

**A (45 sec):** "They can deposit, but they can't: 1) Dynamically hedge delta with perps (requires CEX accounts and 24/7 monitoring), 2) Optimize ranges based on volatility regimes (requires derivatives expertise), 3) Integrate custody and reporting (institutional requirements), 4) Navigate tax implications (complex for IL). We're selling expertise and infrastructure, not just execution."

---

### Q: "What happens in a bear market when yields drop?"

**A (45 sec):** "Two scenarios: 1) Volume drops→fees drop→we adjust ranges or fee tiers, similar to adjusting options strategies in low-vol markets. 2) Strong trends→impermanent loss→we exit positions or widen ranges. Just like we don't sell straddles in trending markets, we wouldn't run tight LP positions in strong trends. The strategy is regime-dependent, which is why clients pay us—they don't want to manage this themselves."

---

### Q: "How does this fit with our existing business?"

**A (30 sec):** "Complements perfectly. We're already market making on CEX. This adds DEX market making for clients who want on-chain execution. Plus, we can use CEX positions to hedge DEX exposure, creating cross-venue arbitrage opportunities. It's an extension of existing capabilities, not a pivot."

---

### Q: "What if regulation crackdowns on DeFi?"

**A (45 sec):** "We're watching closely. Current view: Uniswap protocol itself is decentralized software—no entity to regulate. Our client activity (providing liquidity) is more similar to market making than trading. We're working with legal on client structures to ensure compliance with existing securities laws. If regulatory landscape changes significantly, we can wind down positions in days. But institutional DeFi adoption suggests regulators are finding frameworks, not banning outright."

---

### Q: "Who are the competitors and how do we compare?"

**A (60 sec):** "Three types: 1) DeFi-native firms like Nascent, Framework—they understand DeFi but lack derivatives expertise and can't integrate CEX hedging. 2) TradFi market makers like Jane Street—they're starting to explore but years behind on DeFi infrastructure and regulatory caution. 3) Automated vaults like Gamma, Arrakis—generic strategies, no customization or institutional service. Our edge: We combine derivatives expertise with DeFi operations AND offer integrated CEX+DEX solutions. Nobody else has all three."

## Delivery Tips for "Update" vs "Proposal"

### Do:
- **Be confident** - This IS happening
- **Use "we're doing" not "we want to do"**
- **Show momentum** - "Already deployed $1M, first clients Q2"
- **Focus on revenue** - This is a business opportunity
- **Emphasize client demand** - Pull, not push strategy

### Don't:
- **Don't** sound tentative or experimental
- **Don't** ask for permission (you're informing, not asking)
- **Don't** oversell (let numbers speak)
- **Don't** defend against imagined objections
- **Don't** apologize for anything

### Tone Calibration:

**NOT**: "We think maybe this could work if we try it..."
**YES**: "We're launching this because clients are asking for it and we're uniquely positioned to win."

**NOT**: "Can we get approval to explore...?"
**YES**: "Here's what we're building and why it's strategic."

## The 30-Second Close

After slide 19:

> "Bottom line: We're building a new market making business for institutional clients who need on-chain liquidity. We have the expertise—these are derivatives we already understand. We have client demand—$50M in pipeline. We have the revenue model—$500k Year 1, $1.7M Year 2. Trading desk is executing this with $1M already deployed. What we need from leadership: Support for team scaling and client-facing marketing as we grow. This is where institutional crypto is moving. We're positioning to lead. Questions?"
