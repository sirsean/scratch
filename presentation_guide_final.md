# 15-Minute Presentation Guide: LP as New Derivative Instrument

## Framing: Capability Building, Not Revenue Pitch

**Core Message**: "We now have a new type of derivative to work with. Here's what it is and why it matters."

**Tone**: Matter-of-fact, technical, educational
- NOT: "Exciting opportunity to make money!"
- YES: "Crypto derivatives are maturing. We need to understand them."

**Context**: Clients need on-chain solutions, so we need this capability
- NOT: "We can win $1M in new revenue!"
- YES: "Some clients want on-chain execution. We need to serve that need professionally."

---

## Time Allocation (15 Minutes)

- **Opening + Context**: 2 min - "New derivative in our toolbox"
- **What It Is**: 3 min - LP mechanics and the discovery
- **How It Works**: 5 min - Greeks, risk management, when to use
- **What We're Doing**: 3 min - The $1M initiative and infrastructure
- **Takeaways**: 1 min - Crypto maturity narrative
- **Q&A**: 1 min

---

## The 60-Second Opening (Memorize)

> "Quick update on what the trading desk is doing with Uniswap v3. Bottom line: We discovered that liquidity provider positions are mathematically identical to options strategies we already trade. Since some clients need on-chain liquidity solutions, we need to understand and manage these instruments professionally. This isn't about chasing DeFi trends—it's about having the right tools as crypto markets mature. We're deploying $1M to build infrastructure and expertise, treating these like any other derivative. Let me show you why these are real instruments, not speculation..."

## Key Messages to Emphasize

### 1. **"These are real derivatives, not DeFi magic"**
   - Show the payoff graphs
   - "Look - covered call, collar, same math"
   - "We already understand these. They just trade on-chain."

### 2. **"Crypto is maturing"**
   - $4B TVL, 3 years live, professional infrastructure
   - "This isn't 2017 speculation. It's production-grade."
   - "Markets are evolving. We need to evolve with them."

### 3. **"We're applying existing expertise, not learning something new"**
   - Same Greeks framework
   - Same risk management
   - Just different venue (like trading same instrument on different exchange)

### 4. **"Clients need this capability"**
   - Some want on-chain execution
   - We need to serve professionally
   - Can't say "we don't do that"

### 5. **"This is capability building, not speculation"**
   - Delta-hedged, risk-managed
   - Same discipline as other derivatives
   - Infrastructure investment for future needs

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "Is this really necessary? Can't clients just use centralized exchanges?"

**A (45 sec):** "Some can, and should. But some clients have regulatory or custody requirements that make on-chain execution preferable or mandatory. We're seeing this with protocol treasuries, certain institutional mandates, and regulatory frameworks in some jurisdictions. We need to be able to serve these needs professionally, not tell them 'we don't do that.' It's about having the full toolkit."

---

### Q: "How big will this be as a percentage of our business?"

**A (30 sec):** "Not projecting this as a major revenue driver immediately. It's more about strategic capability. Right now it's $1M for infrastructure and learning. Could scale over time as client needs grow and crypto markets mature, but that's not the primary rationale. Primary rationale is having the capability when clients need it."

---

### Q: "What if DeFi gets regulated out of existence?"

**A (45 sec):** "Possible, but unlikely given current trajectory. Major jurisdictions are creating frameworks to regulate, not ban. EU's MiCA, for example, provides legal clarity. If regulatory landscape shifts dramatically, we can wind down in days—positions are liquid. But the trend is toward legitimization and regulation, not prohibition. Either way, better to understand these instruments and not need them than need them and not understand them."

---

### Q: "This seems different from our core business."

**A (45 sec):** "Respectfully disagree. Our core business is derivatives trading and risk management. These are derivatives—they just trade on-chain instead of on CME or Deribit. The math is the same. The risk framework is the same. The only difference is execution venue. It's like when we started trading crypto futures on CME—same derivative concepts, new venue. This is an evolution of capabilities, not a pivot."

---

### Q: "What's the smart contract risk?"

**A (30 sec):** "Real risk, but Uniswap v3 has $4B TVL and has been live for 3+ years with no exploits. Extensively audited. We're also using position limits—max 20% of any pool, diversification across pools. Similar to how we manage counterparty risk with exchanges. It's manageable, not eliminable."

---

### Q: "Why not wait until this is more mature?"

**A (45 sec):** "Two reasons: One, clients are asking for this now—we can't tell them to wait. Two, expertise building takes time. By the time this is 'mature' in 2-3 years, firms that built capability now will be established providers. Those starting then will be playing catch-up. We saw this with crypto futures—early movers had advantages. Not predicting massive growth, but being ready."

---

### Q: "How does this fit with our existing derivatives business?"

**A (30 sec):** "Integrates well. We can use CEX futures to hedge DEX LP positions. Creates cross-venue arbitrage opportunities. Allows us to manage client assets holistically—some on CEX, some on DEX as needed. It's additive, not either/or. Fuller toolkit means better client service."

## What to Emphasize Based on Audience

### If CTO/Technical in Room:
- Focus on infrastructure (slide 17)
- Greeks framework (slide 6)
- Technical maturity of Uniswap (slide 3)
- Show this is production-ready, not experimental

### If CRO/Risk in Room:
- Greeks and risk management (slides 6, 12)
- Position limits and hedging
- How it fits existing risk framework
- Quantifiable, manageable risk

### If Business Development in Room:
- Client needs briefly (slide 2)

## Delivery Tone: Matter-of-Fact, Not Salesy

### Do:
- **Be technical and professional**
- **Use "we're building capability"**
- **Emphasize applying existing expertise**
- **Frame as markets evolving, not us chasing trends**
- **Show discipline and rigor**

### Don't:
- **Don't** oversell returns or opportunity
- **Don't** make it about making money
- **Don't** emphasize client revenue projections
- **Don't** sound excited about DeFi
- **Don't** dismissive of the instruments

### Calibration:

**NOT**: "This is an exciting new revenue opportunity!"
**YES**: "Crypto derivatives are maturing. We need to understand these instruments."

**NOT**: "Clients will pay us millions for this!"
**YES**: "Some clients need on-chain execution. We're building that capability."

**NOT**: "DeFi is the future and we need to get in early!"
**YES**: "On-chain derivatives exist and are being used. We should know how to work with them."

## The 30-Second Close

After slide 21:

> "To summarize: Liquidity provider positions are derivatives we already understand—same math, same Greeks, just executed on-chain. Since some clients need on-chain execution, we're building this capability professionally. We're deploying $1M to develop infrastructure and expertise, treating these like any other derivative in our toolkit. As crypto markets mature, we need to mature with them. This isn't chasing DeFi trends. It's responsible preparation for where institutional markets are going. Questions?"

---

## The Mindset

**You're not pitching a new business. You're updating on infrastructure investment.**

Trading desk is building capability with a new class of derivatives because:
1. Markets are evolving
2. Clients need it
3. We need to understand these instruments
4. Better to build expertise now than later

This is **strategic preparation**, not **speculative opportunity**.

Present with confidence and technical depth. These are real instruments, professionally managed, fitting within existing risk frameworks.

Go show them why this is responsible capability building. 💼
