# Uniswap v3: New Market Making Business for On-Chain Liquidity
## 15-Minute Executive Update

---

# Executive Summary

**What's Happening**: Trading desk launching $1M Uniswap v3 market making initiative

**The Opportunity**: Win client business from institutions requiring on-chain liquidity

**Our Edge**: Uniswap v3 positions are derivatives we already understand - we can price, risk-manage, and optimize them better than competitors

**Revenue Potential**: New MM mandates from DeFi-native clients + Yield enhancement for existing customer assets

**This Presentation**: Explain the strategy, show why we're uniquely positioned to win

# Why Customers Want On-Chain Liquidity

## Market Demand Drivers:

**DeFi-Native Institutions**
- Crypto funds, DAOs, protocols with $100M+ treasuries
- Need professional market making on-chain
- Can't or won't use centralized exchanges

**Regulatory Advantage**
- On-chain = transparent, auditable
- No custody with exchange counterparties
- Growing preference post-FTX

**Yield Requirements**
- Treasuries need to generate returns
- Traditional options markets: BTC/ETH only
- Uniswap: Any token pair they hold

**24/7 Automated Execution**
- No manual intervention needed
- Protocol handles all rebalancing
- Always-on liquidity provision

**Bottom Line**: This is where institutional money is moving. We need to be there.

# What is Uniswap v3?

**Decentralized exchange** with concentrated liquidity
- $4B+ TVL, dominant DEX by volume
- Deep liquidity in major pairs (ETH/USDC: $400M+)

**How Market Making Works**: Deposit tokens in **price ranges** → Earn fees from every swap

**Example**: ETH/USDC range $2000-$2500
- In range: Earn fees on all trades (0.05% to 1% per swap)
- Out of range: No fees, but no impermanent loss

**Key Innovation**: 200-4000x capital efficiency vs Uniswap v2
- Tighter spreads for customers
- Higher fee capture for LPs
- Professional-grade liquidity provision

---

# Our Discovery: LP Positions ARE Derivatives

## We can price these because they're just options

![LP vs Covered Call](plot_C_covered_call_vs_lp.png)

**Entry at lower bound (all ETH) = Covered Call**
- Upside capped at upper tick
- Earn fees instead of premium
- Same risk profile we already trade

**This is our competitive advantage**: Most DeFi players don't understand traditional derivatives. We do.

---

# LP Positions = Selling Options (Proven)

![LP vs Collar](plot_F_collar_vs_lp.png)

**We analyzed 6 derivative strategies**:
✓ Covered calls
✓ Cash-secured puts
✓ Collars
✓ Short straddles/strangles
✓ Credit spreads

**All match LP payoff structures**

**Why This Matters**:
- We can risk-manage with Greeks framework
- We can hedge with our existing CEX positions
- We can price competitively because we understand the risk

---

# Greeks Framework: Our Edge Over Competitors

![Greeks Dashboard](plot_I_greeks_dashboard.png)

**Delta (Δ)**: Token exposure → Hedge with perps (we already do this)

**Gamma (Γ)**: Negative in range = Impermanent loss
- We understand this: it's short gamma exposure
- Can size positions based on expected volatility

**Theta (θ)**: Fee income = Positive theta
- Like selling options premium
- Optimize range for max theta/gamma ratio

**Most DeFi teams don't think in Greeks. We do. That's the edge.**

# Revenue Opportunity: Client Market Making Mandates

## Who's Asking for This:

**Crypto-Native Funds**
- $50M - $500M AUM
- Need yield on stablecoin holdings
- Want exposure management on token holdings
- Require on-chain execution (regulatory, custody)

**Protocol Treasuries**
- Uniswap, Aave, Maker, etc. have $100M+ treasuries
- Need professional management of their own tokens
- Want to provide liquidity to their users
- Will pay fees for sophisticated strategy

**Family Offices / RIAs**
- Entering crypto, want DeFi exposure
- Need white-glove service
- Premium pricing for expertise

**Estimated Annual Revenue**: $500k - $2M in management fees (0.5-1% of AUM)

---

# Client Value Proposition

## What We Offer That Others Can't:

**Professional Risk Management**
- Greeks-based position sizing
- Dynamic hedging with CEX derivatives
- Real-time monitoring and rebalancing

**Us**: Both worlds integrated

---

# Our Strategy: Delta-Hedged Market Making

**The Core Product**:
1. Client deposits $1M in ETH/USDC LP position
2. We dynamically hedge delta with perp futures
3. Client earns LP fees minus hedging costs
4. Result: 10-20% yield, delta-neutral

**Why Clients Pay Us**:
- They can't execute perp hedges themselves (no exchange accounts)
- They don't have 24/7 monitoring
- They don't understand Greeks
- They want institutional custody + reporting

**Our Fee Structure**:
- 1% AUM management fee
- 10% performance fee on returns above 10%
- Plus spread on hedging execution

**Example**: $10M client position
- Gross yield: 20%
- Net to client: 16-17%
- Our revenue: $100k mgmt + $100k perf = $200k/year

# Expected Returns: Based on Live Market Data

## Base Case (Current Market Conditions):
- ETH/USDC 0.05% pool APR: **25%** (actual 30-day avg)
- Impermanent loss: **-8%** (moderate volatility)
- Hedging costs: **-5%** (perp funding)
- **Net to client: 12%**
- **Our fees: $120k per $10M AUM**

## Bull Case (High Volume Period):
- Pool APR: **40%** (seen during volatility spikes)
- IL: **-5%** (range-bound action)
- Hedging: **-3%** (favorable funding)
- **Net to client: 32%**
- **Client very happy, we get referrals**

## Bear Case (Trending Market):
- Pool APR: **15%** (low volume)
- IL: **-15%** (strong trend)
- Hedging: **-7%** (expensive funding)
- **Net to client: -7%**
- **Risk management: Exit position or widen ranges**

**Key Point**: We're not guaranteeing returns. We're providing professional management of a complex strategy.

# Competitive Landscape

## Who's Already Doing This:

**DeFi-Native Firms** (Nascent, Framework, ParaFi)
- Understand DeFi mechanics
- **Weakness**: Don't have derivatives expertise or CEX integration
- Can't offer hedged products

**TradFi Market Makers** (Jane Street, Jump, Citadel entering)
- Understand derivatives and risk
- **Weakness**: Still learning DeFi, slow to deploy
- Regulatory hesitation

**DeFi Protocols** (Gamma Strategies, Arrakis)
- Automated vault products
- **Weakness**: Generic strategies, no customization
- No institutional service layer

## Our Positioning:

**We sit in the sweet spot**:
- ✓ Understand derivatives (TradFi background)
- ✓ Understand DeFi (building expertise now)
- ✓ Can integrate both (CEX hedging + DEX liquidity)
- ✓ Institutional service (custody, reporting, compliance)

**Competitive Advantage**: Full-stack solution from someone who speaks both languages

# Why This Works Now (Market Timing)

**2024-2025: Institutional DeFi Inflection Point**

1. **Regulatory Clarity Improving**
   - Spot ETF approval = legitimacy
   - MiCA in Europe = clear framework
   - US banks can custody crypto

2. **Infrastructure Matured**
   - Institutional custody solutions available
   - Compliance tools exist (Chainalysis, TRM)
   - Professional service providers (audit, tax)

3. **Post-FTX Shift**
   - Preference for on-chain transparency
   - Reduced CEX trust
   - Demand for non-custodial solutions

4. **Yield Scarcity**
   - TradFi rates declining
   - Crypto staking yields compressed (ETH merge)
   - Active strategies needed for returns

5. **Capital Waiting on Sidelines**
   - Crypto funds raised $10B+ in 2023-24
   - Money looking for sophisticated yield strategies
   - Few providers with institutional credibility

**Our Timing**: Early enough to build expertise, late enough that clients are ready

# What Leadership Should Know

## This is NOT:

❌ An experiment (it's a business initiative)
❌ A side project (it's a trading desk priority)
❌ A tech play (it's a client revenue opportunity)
❌ A bet on crypto going up (it's delta-neutral market making)

## This IS:

✅ **A new service line** for a growing client segment
✅ **Leveraging existing expertise** (derivatives, risk management)
✅ **Addressing real client demand** (on-chain liquidity needs)
✅ **Differentiated positioning** (TradFi + DeFi integration)
✅ **Scalable business model** (software + expertise)

## What We Need from Leadership:

**Support** (not approval - already happening):
- Recognition this is strategic, not experimental
- Resources to hire dedicated team (2-3 people by H2)
- Green light for client marketing materials
- Compliance/legal prioritization for client onboarding

**Not Asking For**:
- Additional capital (trading desk funding approved)
- Special approvals (within existing mandates)
- Risk exceptions (fits existing frameworks)
